# mqtt-mpd-controller
This is  a python script that subscribes to MQTT and invokes commands (espically MPD) depending on what is published

# Installation

Assuming you're on a raspberry pi running the latest (as of this time) raspbian distribution:
```sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

# Caveats

As of now, it is assumed that a local mpd instance is running and mpc is installed.
